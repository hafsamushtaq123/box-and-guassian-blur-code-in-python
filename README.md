# box-and-guassian-blur-code-in-python
This is box blur and guassian blur code in python without open cv and with filters of 3 by 3 and 5 by 5.
 For Box Blur first it takes an image and converts it to grayscale image. Then it asks user if he wants to blur the image using 3 by 3 filter or 5 by 5 filter and then it calls the function 'kernel(image,n)' which will select the 3 by 3 or 5 by 5 window from original image and then it will send that window to a function 'boxblur(arr,n)' which will apply filter and gives the result to first function and when image is completed it is returned and blurred image is printed on the screen. 
 For Guassian blur also the code is same only the filter is change.
